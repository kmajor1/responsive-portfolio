                I am a former Product Manager with 6 years of experience. I decided I liked coding better. So I quit my job, sold my car, took the cash and enrolled in bootcamp! Love coding so far, and looking forward to a career in web development! <br> <br> I also enjoy cinema, non-fiction books, aviation and the outdoors.<br> <br> <br> Avid <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/" target="_blank">Political statistics junkie</a> <br> <em>Proper headshot to follow, in the meantime, enjoy this dog enjoying some Peroni (dramatization) </em>
